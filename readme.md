# This repository contains client and server side of TRLV (the risen Lord's vineyeard website)

# requirements:
1. git
2. conda
3. python

# Source code usage
1. assuming git is installed clone repository by running `git clone https://github.com/08Aristodemus24/<repo name>`
2. assuming conda is also installed run `conda create -n <environment name e.g. some-environment-name> python=x.x.x`. Note python version should be `x.x.x` for the to be created conda environment to avoid dependency/package incompatibility.
3. run `conda activate <environment name used>` or `activate <environment name used>`.
4. run `conda list -e` to see list of installed packages. If pip is not yet installed run conda install pip, otherwise skip this step and move to step 5.
5. navigate to directory containing the `requirements.txt` file.
5. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file
6. after installing packages/dependencies run `python index.py` while in this directory to run app locally

# App usage:
1. control panel of app will have 3 inputs: prompt, temperature, and sequence length. Prompt can be understood as the starting point in which our model will append certain words during generation for instance if the prompt given is "jordan" then model might generate "jordan is a country in the middle east" and so on. Temperature input can be understood as "how much the do you want the model to generate diverse sequences or words?" e.g. if a diversity of 2 (this is the max value for diversity/temperature by the way) then then the model might potentially generate incomprehensible words (almost made up words) e.g. "jordan djanna sounlava kianpo". And lastly Sequence Length is how long do you want the generated sequence to be in terms of character length for isntance if sequence length is 10 then generated sequence would be "jordan is."
